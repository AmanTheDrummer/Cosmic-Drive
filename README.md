# Cosmic-Drive
### My first ever project.
It is a game where you have to control a spaceship and avoid falling meteors. As you progress, the neteors fall in greater numbers and speeds. 
It has a complete filing system to manage data stored. It has a resource manager to efficiently look-up all the assets needed to load.
